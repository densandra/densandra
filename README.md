# Hi and welcome to my profile!

### 🛠️ UNDER CONSTRUCTION 🛠️
There is not much going on on my GitHub account yet, but I'm working on uploading some of my older projects. I'm also looking forward to start some new ones as well as to contribute more to open source projects in the future.

### About me:
- I’m currently learning git, Python, linear algebra, LaTeX
- I want to learn more about statistics, data science
- My goals for 2022 are to focus on my studies, to read more and to eat cleaner
- My interests are hiking, windsurfing, theatre, cooking and my herb garden 🌱
